# 🎙️ AI Voice Assistant

A sleek, Python-based desktop voice assistant with a Tkinter GUI. This assistant can listen to your commands, speak back using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS), and handle tasks like weather reporting, news fetching, and setting reminders.

## 🚀 Features

- **Voice Interaction**: Uses `SpeechRecognition` and `gTTS` for natural communication.
- **Weather API**: Get real-time weather for any city (e.g., "What is the weather in Tokyo?").
- **Daily News**: Stay updated with the latest headlines via Google News RSS.
- **Smart Reminders**: Set reminders using natural language (e.g., "Remind me in 10 minutes").
- **Windows Optimized**: Uses `pygame` for non-blocking, crash-free audio playback.
- **Clean UI**: A simple, modern Tkinter interface with a status monitor.
